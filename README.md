GotowTutorial-Unity5-WheelColliderSource
========================================

This proof-of-concept combines the [Open Source Wheel Collider](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=WheelColliderSource) with my C# conversion of Gotow's Unity Car Tutorial from 2009.

Physics parameters will need to be tweaked
Motor audio is disabled (not looping correctly). 
Upgraded to work with Unity 5.0 Personal Edition

C# Scripts converted with [M2H's online JS-to-C# converter](http://www.m2h.nl/files/js_to_c.php)
