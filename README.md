This proof-of-concept project combines the [Open Source Wheel Collider](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=WheelColliderSource) with my C# conversion of Gotow's Unity Car Tutorial from 2009.

Physics parameters may need to be tweaked further due to Unity physics implementation differences in V4 and V5. Motor audio is re-enabled for Web Player settings (not looping correctly for WebGL at the moment). Project has been upgraded to work with Unity 5.0 Personal Edition

C# Scripts converted with [M2H's online JS-to-C# converter](http://www.m2h.nl/files/js_to_c.php)
